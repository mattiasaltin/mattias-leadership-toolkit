# ⚖️ Balancing Delivery vs Discovery

Balancing delivery and discovery is crucial for building the right products effectively. This
section explores strategies for achieving this balance.

Discovery involves learning about customer needs, validating assumptions, and exploring solutions
before committing to building them. Delivery involves building, testing, and shipping products.
Effective product development requires both: discovery to ensure you're building the right thing,
and delivery to ensure you're building it well.
