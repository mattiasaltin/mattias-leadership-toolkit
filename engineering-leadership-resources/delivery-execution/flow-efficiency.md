# 🌊 Flow Efficiency

Flow efficiency is about optimizing the flow of work through a system to maximize value delivery.
This section explores techniques for improving flow efficiency.

Flow efficiency measures the percentage of time work is actively being worked on versus waiting
in queues. High flow efficiency means work moves quickly through the system with minimal delays,
enabling faster delivery and better responsiveness to customer needs.
