# 📋 Product Operating Model

A product operating model defines how a company delivers value through its products. This
section explores frameworks and strategies for aligning teams, processes, and technology to
optimize product delivery.

**Why This Is in Engineering Leadership:** Engineering leaders need to understand product
operating models to align technical delivery with product strategy. The operating model
determines how engineering teams are organized, how they interact with product teams, and how
technical work supports product goals. Understanding product operating models helps engineering
leaders make better decisions about team structure, technical architecture, and delivery
processes.

A product operating model encompasses team structure, decision-making processes, and how
product, engineering, and design collaborate to deliver value. It defines the "how" of product
development, complementing product strategy's "what" and "why."
