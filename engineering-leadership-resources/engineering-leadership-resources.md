# 🌱 Engineering Leadership Resources

## A mixed bag of resources that helps us grow as leaders

## 👋 Introduction

*Hello, I'm [Mattias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattiasaltin/)!*

*Over the years, I've come across some incredible resources that have shaped the way I work and think as an engineering leader. I often find myself revisiting these gems, and I'm sharing this collection because one question I frequently get is: "What book or article would you recommend for learning more about this?" The truth is, I always struggle to pick just one - it's never that simple!*

*This list has grown over time (maybe a bit too much!), but the idea is that it serves as a place you can dip into whenever you're looking for inspiration, guidance, or just something interesting to read or watch.*

*Most of the resources here are suited for engineering leaders at all levels, from Engineering Manager to CTO, and I've organised them around what I consider the three core areas of accountability for anyone in these roles:*

* ***🧠 Organisational Health:** Building and nurturing high-performing teams and culture*  
* ***⚙️ Technical Health:** Ensuring sustainable technical excellence*  
* *🚀 **Delivery & Execution:** Optimizing for value delivery*

*While [I personally love diving into books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67804807-mattias-altin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&utf8=%E2%9C%93&title=mattias-altin&per_page=infinite), I know everyone has their own preferred way of learning, so I've made an effort to include a mix of formats. You'll see icons next to each resource to help you find what works best for you:*

* *📘 Book*  
* *🎥 Video/Talk*  
* *📄 Article/Blog Post*  
* *🎧 Podcast*  
* *📊 Research Paper/Whitepaper*

*I hope you find this collection helpful and that it sparks new ideas or perspectives in your own leadership journey. If you have any favourites I've missed or other recommendations, I'd genuinely love to hear from you - there's always more to learn!*

*Thank you for taking the time to explore this list, and I hope it's a valuable resource for you.*

*Warm regards,*  
*Mattias Altin*  
*P.S. This document is constantly evolving, so don't be alarmed if it's changed between visits!*
