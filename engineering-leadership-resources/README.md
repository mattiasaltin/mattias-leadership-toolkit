# 🌱 Engineering Leadership Resources

## 👋 Introduction

Hello, I'm [Mattias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattiasaltin/)\!

Over the years, I've come across some incredible resources that have shaped the way I work and
think as an engineering leader. I often find myself revisiting these gems, and I'm sharing this
collection because one question I frequently get is: "What book or article would you recommend
for learning more about this?" The truth is, I always struggle to pick just one - it's never
that simple!

This list has grown over time (maybe a bit too much!), but the idea is that it serves as a
place you can dip into whenever you're looking for inspiration, guidance, or just something
interesting to read or watch.

Most of the resources here are suited for engineering leaders at all levels, from Engineering
Manager to CTO, and I've organised them around what I consider the three core areas of
accountability for anyone in these roles:

- **🧠 Organisational Health:** Building and nurturing high-performing teams and culture  
- **⚙️ Technical Health:** Ensuring sustainable technical excellence  
- **🚀 Delivery & Execution:** Optimising for value delivery

For practical reasons we also have a fourth catch-all area:

- **📦 Other:** Anything else that could be useful

While [I personally love diving into
books](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67804807-mattias-altin?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&utf8=%E2%9C%93&title=mattias-altin&per_page=infinite),
I know everyone has their own preferred way of learning, so I've made an effort to include a
mix of formats. You'll see icons next to each resource to help you find what works best for
you:

- 📘 Book  
- 🎥 Video/Talk  
- 📄 Article/Blog Post  
- 🎧 Podcast  
- 📊 Research Paper/Whitepaper

I hope you find this collection helpful and that it sparks new ideas or perspectives in your
own leadership journey. If you have any favourites I've missed or other recommendations, I'd
genuinely [love to hear from you](CONTRIBUTING.md) - there's always more to learn!

Warm regards,  
Mattias Altin  
P.S. This document is constantly evolving, so don't be alarmed if it's changed between visits!
