# 🧪 Testing

Testing is a critical component of software development, ensuring that applications function
correctly and meet user expectations. This section covers testing strategies, tools, and best
practices.

Effective testing requires a comprehensive strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests,
and end-to-end tests, organized in a test pyramid that emphasizes fast, reliable unit tests
while using higher-level tests strategically. Testing culture and mindset are equally important,
ensuring teams value quality and see testing as an integral part of development.
