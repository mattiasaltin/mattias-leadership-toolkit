# 📊 KPIs

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are essential for measuring the success of engineering
efforts. This section provides insights into selecting and using KPIs to drive performance and
align with business goals.

Effective KPIs help engineering leaders understand team performance, identify improvement
opportunities, and align engineering efforts with business objectives. The key is selecting
metrics that drive the right behaviors and avoiding metrics that incentivize counterproductive
actions.
