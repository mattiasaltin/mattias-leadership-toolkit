# 🌟 Product Vision

> "Leadership is about inspiring the organization and management is about guiding us there." — Marty Cagan

Product vision is your organization's North Star - not just for individual teams, but for the
entire company. It describes the meaningful objective that everyone is contributing to. Many
companies make the mistake of creating separate visions per product team, but this misses the
fundamental purpose: every good product designer and engineer wants to contribute to something
larger than themselves. A compelling product vision provides that higher purpose and direction.

A strong product vision paints a picture of a future state where your product has transformed
how people work, live, or solve problems. It's aspirational yet achievable, providing
inspiration and direction for all product decisions.
