# 🔢 Product Priorities

> "The product leadership's job is to define the organization's objectives."

Product priorities are about focusing teams on outcomes rather than output. While there are
many techniques for achieving this, the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system has become the
most popular. However, it's crucial to avoid the common pitfall of having multiple teams moving
in different directions. True product leadership means defining clear organizational objectives
that align all teams toward common goals.
