# 📣 Product Evangelism

> "We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries." — John Doerr

Product evangelism is a continuous, crucial responsibility in any organization. Leaders must
constantly share and promote their vision, converting team members from mercenaries (who
simply build features on a roadmap) into missionaries (who are truly empowered and believe in
the product's purpose). This ongoing effort ensures that teams remain inspired and aligned with
the organization's vision.

Effective product evangelism involves storytelling, building internal alignment, and creating
a product culture where teams understand and believe in the product's purpose and impact.
