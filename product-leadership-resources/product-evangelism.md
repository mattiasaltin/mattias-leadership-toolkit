# 📢 Product Evangelism

> "We need teams of missionaries, not teams of mercenaries." — John Doerr

Product evangelism is a continuous, crucial responsibility in any organization. Leaders must constantly share and promote their vision, converting team members from mercenaries (who simply build features on a roadmap) into missionaries (who are truly empowered and believe in the product's purpose). This ongoing effort ensures that teams remain inspired and aligned with the organization's vision.
