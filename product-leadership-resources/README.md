# 🌟 Product Leadership Resources

## 👋 Introduction

Hello, I’m [Mattias](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattiasaltin/)\!

Welcome to the Product Leadership Resources. This collection is designed to support product
leaders in navigating the complexities of product management and leadership. Whether you're
defining product vision, strategising, or managing teams, these resources aim to provide
valuable insights and guidance.

Thank you for exploring these resources, and I hope they inspire and support you in your leadership journey!

I've tried to collect a diverse set of content in different formats:

- 📘 Book  
- 🎥 Video/Talk  
- 📄 Article/Blog Post  
- 🎧 Podcast  
- 📊 Research Paper/Whitepaper

Warm regards,

## 📚 Overview

Product leadership consists of two fundamental aspects: leadership accountabilities that focus
on product direction and strategy, and management accountabilities that focus on people and
execution.

The structure of the resources has been based on the excellent book EMPOWERED by Marty Cagan,
and covers both the leadership and manager accountabilities of a product leader. For more
information about the EMPOWERED framework, see the [Key Frameworks Referenced](../README.md#key-frameworks-referenced) section.
