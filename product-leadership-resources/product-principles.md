# 🧭 Product Principles

> "Product principles describe the nature of the kind of product we're trying to create."

Product principles are the fundamental beliefs and guidelines that shape your product decisions.
They define not just what you build, but how you build it and why. These principles serve as a
decision-making framework, helping teams stay aligned with the organization's values and vision
while making day-to-day product decisions.

Well-defined product principles help teams make consistent decisions without constant oversight,
enabling autonomy while maintaining alignment with strategic goals.
