# 🗺️ Product Strategy

> "Product strategy represents important choices about what problems to solve, and in what order."

Product strategy is about turning your ambitious vision into reality through intentional
choices. Rather than trying to solve everyone's problems simultaneously, effective product
strategy involves making intelligent, deliberate decisions about which problems to tackle and
in what sequence. While it often manifests as a series of product-market fits, the key is
making strategic choices that move you toward your vision.

Product strategy defines where to play and how to win in the market. It involves understanding
customer needs, competitive positioning, market dynamics, and resource allocation to create
sustainable competitive advantage.
