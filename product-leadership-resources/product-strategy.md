# 🗺️ Product Strategy

> "Product strategy represents important choices about what problems to solve, and in what order."

Product strategy is about turning your ambitious vision into reality through intentional choices. Rather than trying to solve everyone's problems simultaneously, effective product strategy involves making intelligent, deliberate decisions about which problems to tackle and in what sequence. While it often manifests as a series of product-market fits, the key is making strategic choices that move you toward your vision.
