# 🎯 Objectives

> "Great product people know what they don't know, and they admit it." — Marty Cagan

Effective managers collaborate to determine how their teams will deliver on organizational objectives, then work with individual teams to define specific results. This process involves give-and-take, with teams proposing how they'll achieve these objectives while maintaining alignment with the broader organization's goals.
