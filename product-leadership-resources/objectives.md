# 🎯 Objectives

> "Great product people know what they don't know, and they admit it." — Marty Cagan

Setting objectives happens at both the organizational and team levels. Effective managers
collaborate to determine how their teams will deliver on organizational objectives, then work
with individual teams to define specific results. This process involves give-and-take, with
teams proposing how they'll achieve these objectives while maintaining alignment with the
broader organization's goals.
