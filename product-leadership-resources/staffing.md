# 🧠 Staffing

> "It doesn't make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do. We hire smart people so they can tell us what to do." ― Steve Jobs

Staffing is not just an HR function - it's a crucial responsibility of people managers. The hiring manager's role is to source, recruit, and convince the right people to join the organization. This involves not just finding competent individuals, but also selling them on the vision and demonstrating why they should contribute to your mission.
